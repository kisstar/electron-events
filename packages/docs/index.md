# electron-events ([中文](./zh/index.md))

`electron-events` provides a cross process event communication system based on the ipcMain and ipcRenderer modules.

It mainly provides two modes: [Broadcast mode](./en/api/broadcast.md) and [Responsive mode](./en/api/response.md).

If you are using TypeScript, it may be helpful to take a look at some of the [type declarations](./en/api/ts.md) provided internally.
